THOUGH three men dwell on Flannan Isle
To keep the lamp alight,
As we steered under the lee, we caught
No glimmer through the night."

A passing ship at dawn had brought
The news; and quickly we set sail,
To find out what strange thing might ail
The keepers of the deep-sea light.

All  three were vanished into thin air and only,
steves boots ere found 
and the dinner was kept on the table as if it was never eaten
